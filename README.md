# SQL-Library

This project focuses on creating an application for a local library to help them manage their collection of books. My application's task is to provide a more intuitive way to manage the library's collection of books. The web application will provide pages to list, add, update, and delete books. 
* Adjusted provided CSS styling by changing color and adding pictures to "error.pug" and "page-not-found.pug" layout.

For this project:

* Given the HTML designs and an existing SQLite database, I implemented a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite and the SQL ORM Sequelize.
* Familiarizing myself with the work of implementing and utilizing a database for data persistence, as well as leveraging helpful database related tools to view and interact with the database.

## To Start Project:
* Run npm start in terminal and open http://localhost:3000 to view in browser.
