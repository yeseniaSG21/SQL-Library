# SQL-Library

This project focuses on creating an application for my local library to help them manage their collection of books. My application's task is to provide a more intuitive way to manage the library's collection of books. The web application will provide pages to list, add, update, and delete books. 
* Adjusted provided CSS styling by changing color and adding pictures to "error.pug" and "page-not-found.pug" layout.



You'll be given HTML designs and an existing SQLite database. You'll be required to implement a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite and the SQL ORM Sequelize.

This project will provide a great opportunity to start familiarizing yourself with the work of implementing and utilizing a database for data persistence, as well as leveraging helpful database related tools to view and interact with your database.

After completing this project, youâ€™ll be able to add true data persistence in your own projects, and implement, modify, interact with and maintain your own local custom SQLite database. You will also have a powerful new skill to add to your resume.
